# HelloBD News — Load Test Results

> **Test Date:** February 18, 2026  
> **Target:** [https://hellobd.news](https://hellobd.news)  
> **Tool:** Artillery.io  
> **Test Type:** Extreme Category Page Load Test (100–1000 users/sec)

---

## 🔴 Overall Status: CRITICAL

The server came under severe stress during the extreme load test. At peak load (1000 users/sec), the failure rate reached **98.59%**, indicating the server cannot sustain this level of traffic without infrastructure improvements.

## 📍 Endpoint Breakdown

| Endpoint                    | Failure Rate | P95 Tail Latency |
|-----------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| /category/international     | 0.0%         | 9,607.1 ms       |
| /category/bangladesh        | 0.0%         | 9,416.8 ms       |
| /category/sports            | 0.0%         | 9,416.8 ms       |

> ⚠️ *Note: Endpoint-level failure rates show 0% because most failures occurred at the connection/session level before reaching individual endpoints.*

## 📉 Daily Projection

Based on current traffic patterns, if this load level continued for **1 hour**, potential visitor loss would exceed **920,155 visitors**.

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

1. **Server collapses above ~260 req/sec** — The site begins to fail significantly beyond the warning zone.
2. **Extreme tail latency** — P95 response time hit the 10-second ceiling, meaning 5% of users waited over 10 seconds.
3. **No CDN buffering detected** — Category pages appear to hit the origin server directly under load.
4. **Database bottleneck suspected** — High latency pattern suggests slow category filter queries under concurrent load.

---

## ✅ Recommended Fixes

1. **Enable CDN caching** for category pages to reduce origin server load.
2. **Optimize database queries** for category filters (add indexes, query caching).
3. **Horizontal scaling** — Add more server instances if arrival rates exceed 50 users/sec.
4. **Rate limiting / queue** — Implement request queuing to gracefully handle traffic spikes.
5. **Load balancer** — Distribute traffic across multiple application servers.
