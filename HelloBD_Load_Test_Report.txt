             HelloBD NEWS: CATEGORY WISE LOAD TEST REPORT
************************************************************

OVERALL STATUS: [CRITICAL] CRITICAL
REPORT GENERATE DATE: February 19, 2026

1. TEST DETAILS & METHODOLOGY
--------------------------------------
The test simulated a progressive load on the category pages with 9 defined phases:
- Warmup: 30s, 100 users/sec
- Push: 30s, 150 users/sec
- Hard Push: 30s, 250 users/sec
- Overload: 30s, 350 users/sec
- Extreme: 30s, 500 users/sec
- Brutal: 30s, 650 users/sec
- Savage: 30s, 800 users/sec
- Catastrophic: 30s, 900 users/sec
- Max Load: 30s, 1000 users/sec

- **Total Duration:** 280 Seconds
- **Average Request Rate:** 30270 requests every minute
- **Total Traffic Volume:** 141501 Total Requests

2. VISITOR SUCCESS & FAILURE BREAKDOWN
------------------------------------------
Network traffic analysis results:

- **SUCCESSFUL ENTRANCES:** 634 (0.45% of all visitors)
- **FAILED ATTEMPTS:** 140867 (99.55% of all visitors)
- **DAILY PROJECTION:** Based on current traffic patterns, if this load continues for 
  just 1 hour, potential visitor loss would exceed 1807932.

3. LOSS CALCULATION BY SITE SECTION
---------------------------------------
Failure rate analysis by category:

- **/CATEGORY/INTERNATIONAL:** 99.6% Failure Rate (9801.2ms Tail Latency)
- **/CATEGORY/BANGLADESH:** 99.5% Failure Rate (9801.2ms Tail Latency)
- **/CATEGORY/SPORTS:** 99.5% Failure Rate (9801.2ms Tail Latency)

*Observation: There is noticeable stress on certain endpoints as load increases.*

4. PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION (ANALYSIS)
------------------------------------------
Server response time analysis:
- **Speed Test:** The median response time was **4316.6ms**.
- **Stress Test:** The P95 (slowest 5%) reached **9999.2ms**.
- **Observation:** The server is returning some errors under pressure.

5. CALCULATED CAPACITY LIMITS
---------------------------------
Operational zones based on test data:

- **SAFE ZONE:** Up to 403.6 Requests Per Second.
- **WARNING ZONE:** Over 504.5 Requests Per Second.

6. RECOMMENDED FIXES (ACTION PLAN)
----------------------------------------
1. Ensure the category pages are properly cached at the Edge (CDN).
2. Monitor database query execution times for category filters.
3. Consider horizontal scaling if arrival rates exceed 50 users/sec.
