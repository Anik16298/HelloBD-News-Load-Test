             HELLOBD NEWS: MY DETAILED PERFORMANCE REPORT
************************************************************

OVERALL STATUS: 🔴 CRITICAL (I need to take action)
MY CALCULATION DATE: February 17, 2026

1. WHAT I DID IN THIS TEST (MY MATH)
--------------------------------------
I simulated a highly aggressive "stepped" load over a 300-second period. 
I increased the pressure every 30 seconds to find the exact breaking point.

- **My Total Duration:** 300 Seconds (5 Minutes)
- **My Total Load:** 100 to 1,000 Concurrent Users
- **My Average Request Rate:** 3,300 requests every minute
- **My Total Traffic Volume:** 16,500 Total Connection Attempts

2. MY VISITOR SUCCESS & FAILURE BREAKDOWN
------------------------------------------
I broke down the numbers to see exactly how many people we are losing:

- **SUCCESSFUL ENTRANCES:** 10,094 (61.18% of all visitors)
- **FAILED ATTEMPS:** 6,406 (38.82% of all visitors)
- **DAILY PROJECTION:** Based on my math, if this traffic level continues for 
  just 1 hour, we would lose over **76,800 potential visitors.**

3. MY LOSS CALCULATION BY SITE SECTION
---------------------------------------
I calculated the failure rate for each part of the site I tested:

- **HOMEPAGE:** 39.1% Failure Rate (1,965 people lost)
- **BANGLADESH NEWS:** 38.8% Failure Rate (1,275 people lost)
- **INTERNATIONAL NEWS:** 38.3% Failure Rate (1,239 people lost)
- **SPORTS/ENT:** 39.6% Failure Rate (1,264 people lost)
- **POLICY PAGES:** 39.1% Failure Rate (657 people lost)

*My Observation: The failure is perfectly consistent across the board, 
proving it's a "front door" server issue, not a page-specific error.*

4. THE PROBLEM I IDENTIFIED (MY ANALYSIS)
------------------------------------------
I found that our "Server Door" (Connection Handling) is far too narrow.
- **My Speed Test:** For the lucky few who got in, the site responded in 
  just **102ms (Median)**. That is extremely fast!
- **My Stress Test:** However, the server actively rejected **21.3 connections 
  every single second** during the peak load.

5. MY CALCULATED CAPACITY LIMITS
---------------------------------
I have crunched the numbers to define our safe operating zones:

- ✅ **MY SAFE ZONE:** Up to **600 Requests Per Minute (10/sec)**.
  (All connections are handled perfectly here).

- ⚠️ **MY WARNING ZONE:** **720-900 Requests Per Minute (12-15/sec)**.
  (I calculated a 5-10% connection drop-off here).

- 🔴 **MY DANGER ZONE:** **1,200+ Requests Per Minute (20+/sec)**.
  (I saw the failure rate jump to nearly 40%).

6. MY RECOMMENDED FIXES (TAKING ACTION)
----------------------------------------
1. I need to boost our **Max Connections** limit. My math shows we need to 
   handle at least 3x the current capacity to survive a viral event.
2. I suggest we put **Cloudflare (CDN)** in front. It can handle these 
   "slamming door" issues before they ever touch our server.
3. I'll check our **Firewall settings**. It's likely my test traffic was 
   automatically flagged as a "threat" because it was too fast.
